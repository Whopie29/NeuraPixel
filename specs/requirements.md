# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create an AI-powered image generator web application that allows users to input text prompts and generate corresponding images using deep learning models. The application will provide a simple, intuitive interface where users can enter descriptive text, generate images, and download the results.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to enter a text prompt describing an image I want to generate, so that I can create custom images based on my imagination.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the system SHALL display a text input field for entering prompts
2. WHEN a user types in the text input field THEN the system SHALL accept alphanumeric characters, spaces, and common punctuation
3. WHEN a user enters a prompt longer than 500 characters THEN the system SHALL display a character limit warning
4. WHEN a user submits an empty prompt THEN the system SHALL display an error message requesting a valid prompt

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to generate an image by pressing enter or clicking a generate button, so that I can quickly create images without complex interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user presses the Enter key in the prompt field THEN the system SHALL initiate the image generation process
2. WHEN a user clicks the generate button THEN the system SHALL initiate the image generation process
3. WHEN image generation starts THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator
4. WHEN image generation is in progress THEN the system SHALL disable the generate button to prevent multiple simultaneous requests
5. WHEN image generation completes successfully THEN the system SHALL display the generated image
6. WHEN image generation fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to download the generated image, so that I can save and use it for my purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is successfully generated THEN the system SHALL display a download button
2. WHEN a user clicks the download button THEN the system SHALL initiate a file download
3. WHEN downloading THEN the system SHALL provide the image in a common format (PNG or JPEG)
4. WHEN downloading THEN the system SHALL use a descriptive filename based on the prompt or timestamp

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to have a clean, responsive interface, so that I can use it comfortably on different devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application on desktop THEN the system SHALL display a properly formatted interface
2. WHEN a user accesses the application on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout for smaller screens
3. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL use modern, clean styling with appropriate contrast
4. WHEN elements are interactive THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback (hover states, focus indicators)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the image generation to be reasonably fast and reliable, so that I can efficiently create multiple images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a prompt THEN the system SHALL generate an image within 30 seconds under normal conditions
2. WHEN the AI service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message
3. WHEN generation takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL show progress indication
4. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent requests appropriately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my generated image clearly displayed, so that I can evaluate the result before downloading.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is generated THEN the system SHALL display it at an appropriate size for viewing
2. WHEN displaying the image THEN the system SHALL maintain the original aspect ratio
3. WHEN the image is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the original prompt used for generation
4. WHEN viewing the image THEN the system SHALL provide adequate spacing and visual separation from other elements
